# In Elixir, strings are concatenated with the "<>" operator

# Example
our_str = "I come first. "
our_str <> "I come second."
# => "I come first. I come second."

# Only change code below this line

my_str = "This is the first sentence. "
my_str <> "This is the second sentence."
# => "This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence."
